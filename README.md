Batch-FLP-to-MP3
================

This is an AutoHotkey script that allows for the exporting of multiple FLP files in Fl Studio to MP3.

Instructions:

* Make sure that none of your songs have the display project info turned on (F11 opens the project info window, uncheck 'show it on openning' if it is checked).
* If there is already an MP3 file of the project in the flp project folder, this application will not work past the point of reaching that song.

Bugs:

* I've only tested this at length once. It exported 17 songs in a row and then got stuck at the 18th.

Future Features:

* If people want to be able to export to WAV files as well, it would be easy to make an interface where you can choose either MP3, WAV, or both.
